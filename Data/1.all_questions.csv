It incorrectly parses world :) as one token. How can I modify spaCy so it recognizes these additional symbols? Thanks.

14,Spacy,Documentation,documentation,Documentation aspect,57206701,Spacy tokenizer rule for exceptions that contain whitespace?,"When I create a pipeline with the default tokenizer for say English, I can then call the method for adding a special case:

The tokenizer will happily accept a special case that contains whitespace:

tokenizer.add_special_case(""some odd case"", case)
but it appears that does not actually change the behavior of the tokenizer or will never match?

More generally, what is the best way of extending an existing tokenizer so that the some patterns which normally would result in multiple tokens only create one token? For example something like [A-Za-z]+\([A-Za-z0-9]+\)[A-Za-z]+ should not result in three tokens because of the parentheses but in a single token, e.g. for asdf(a33b)xyz while the normal English rules should still apply if that pattern does not match.

Is this something that can be done somehow by augmenting an existing tokenizer or would I have to first tokenize, then find entities that match the corresponding token patterns and then merge the entity tokens?","As you found, Tokenizer.add_special_case() doesn't work for handling tokens that contain whitespace. That's for adding strings like ""o'clock"" and "":-)"", or expanding e.g. ""don't"" to ""do not"".

Modifying the prefix, suffix and infix rules (either by setting them on an existing tokenizer or creating a new tokenizer with custom parameters) also doesn't work since those are applied after whitespace splitting.

To override the whitespace splitting behavior, you have four options:

Merge after tokenization. You use Retokenizer.merge(), or possibly merge_entities or merge_noun_chunks. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#retokenization and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_entities and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_noun_chunks

This is your best bet for keeping as much of the default behavior as possible.
Subclass Tokenizer and override __call__. Sample code:

Implement a completely new tokenizer (without subclassing Tokenizer). Relevant docs here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#custom-tokenizer-example
Tokenize externally and instantiate Doc with words. Relevant docs here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#own-annotations
To answer the second part of your question, if you don't need to change whitespace splitting behavior, you have two other options:

Add to the default prefix, suffix and infix rules. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#native-tokenizer-additions

Note from https://stackoverflow.com/a/58112065/594211: ""You can add new patterns without defining a custom tokenizer, but there's no way to remove a pattern without defining a custom tokenizer.""

What you are describing is called ""online learning"" and the default spaCy models don't support it. Most modern neural NER methods, even outside of spaCy, have no support for it at all.

You cannot fix this by using a custom training loop.

Your options are to use rule-based matching, so you can only match things explicitly in a list, or to retrain models on the fly.

Rule-based matching should be easy to set up but has the obvious issue that it can't learn things not explicitly in the list.

My first naive attempt was to load it via spacy.load('bert-base-uncased'), it didn't work because spacy demands a certain structure, which is understandable.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to use the spacy-transformers library to load the model, create the spacy structure, and use it from that point as a normal spacy-aware model.

I don't know if it is even possible as I couldn't find anything regarding the subject. I've tried to read the documentation but all guides, examples, and posts I found, start from a spacy structured model like spacy/en_core_web_sm, but how did that model was created in the first place?

","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models.

My first naive attempt was to load it via spacy.load('bert-base-uncased'), it didn't work because spacy demands a certain structure, which is understandable.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to use the spacy-transformers library to load the model, create the spacy structure, and use it from that point as a normal spacy-aware model.

I don't know if it is even possible as I couldn't find anything regarding the subject.

","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

To pull from the docs, this is how you specify a custom model in a config:

[components.transformer.model]

# XXX You can change the model name here
name = ""bert-base-cased""
tokenizer_config = {""use_fast"": true}
Going back to why you need to understand spaCy's structure, it's very important to understand that in spaCy, Transformers are only sources of features. If your HuggingFace model has an NER head or something it will not work. So if you use a custom model, you'll need to train other components, like NER, on top of it.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models. These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

34,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,42215762,How to get Spacy to tokenize am/pm expressions correctly?,"Spacy seems unable to correctly tokenize am/pm expressions where the number and the am/pm part is not separated by whitespace.

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

You didn't mention this in your question, but is treating each sentence/line as a separate doc an option? (It's not clear if you're combining multiple lines and the sentence boundaries are wrong, or if you're passing in a single line but it's turning into multiple sentences.)

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

You didn't mention this in your question, but is treating each sentence/line as a separate doc an option? (It's not clear if you're combining multiple lines and the sentence boundaries are wrong, or if you're passing in a single line but it's turning into multiple sentences.)

Thanks a million for you answer! It made me go back to my documents and check every output of every element in the pipeline... Well, I feel terribly stupid, but I simply cannot reproduce my observation of a ""deffective parser"", everything seems fine now. I guess after my initial struggle with forcing my own sentence boundaries (which wasn't even actually that complicated ...), I convinced myself somehow it wasn't working even after my own boundaries were set ?

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

47,Spacy,Stability,version,Stability aspect,46826541,Methods for creating training data for SpaCy models?,"I recently began a NLP journey using SpaCy, and I have ~5,500 strings which I want to label up. For the first 100, I did this using a spreadsheet with custom columns, which was then run through a script to generate Python dictionaries. In the sheet, I have strored the string, label type, label value. The script then works out the position of the label value from within the string.

It's rather time consuming to product training data in this way, and it's open to error.

Are there any tools available to assist with this? I literally just need the ability to highlight a substring, and then choose the label type. I could build it myself, but I feel it may already exist.","I'm one of the maintainers of spaCy and we've actually been thinking about this problem a lot! So we've built Prodigy, an annotation tool that integrates with spaCy and puts the model in the loop to help you train and evaluate models faster. It's currently in beta, but you can sign up for a free invite. Prodigy takes a slightly different approach to the click-drag-highlight-select concept of other annotation tools. It uses the model in the loop to suggest annotations with the most relevant gradient for training, and only asks you for a simple binary feedback: accept or reject. This lets you move through examples quickly. As you annotate, the model in the loop is updated, and its predictions will influence what Prodigy asks next.

All models are also attached as archives to the v1.6 release – so in the meantime, you can always download them manually from there, unzip the archive and place the contained folder in spacy/data.

If you don't have to use v1.3, I'd also recommend checking out the newer versions and upgrading to spaCy v1.7+. Models are now hosted on GitHub, which makes the downloading process more transparent and doesn't rely on a separate download server. They're also wrapped as native Python packages, which lets you install them via pip, add them to your project's requirements.txt and even import them as a module at the top of your file. You can read more about this in the models documentation.

This makes it easier to manage model dependencies, especially as more models become available. If you're using spaCy 1.8+, you'll be able to use models for English, German, French and Spanish. If you have trained your own models and decide to upgrade, note that you will have to retrain your models with the input from the new version.

Matching dependency patterns instead of linear patterns might slightly improve your results
That being said, what you're trying to do – kind of sentiment analysis -is quite a difficult task that's normally engaged with machine learning approaches and heaps of training data. So don't expect too much from simple heuristics.

This type of problem inherently takes time.

Long answer

Use regular expressions
Change the spacy pipeline

Spacy's parser is doing sentence segmentation and you're iterating over doc.sents, so you'll see each sentence it exported separately. If you want to provide your own sentence segmentation, you can do that with a custom component, e.g.:

Add to the default prefix, suffix and infix rules. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#native-tokenizer-additions

Note from https://stackoverflow.com/a/58112065/594211: ""You can add new patterns without defining a custom tokenizer, but there's no way to remove a pattern without defining a custom tokenizer.""
Instantiate Tokenizer with custom prefix, suffix and infix rules. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#native-tokenizers

To get the default rules, you read the existing tokenizer's attributes (as shown above) or use the nlp object’s Defaults.

14,Spacy,Documentation,documentation,Documentation aspect,57206701,Spacy tokenizer rule for exceptions that contain whitespace?,"When I create a pipeline with the default tokenizer for say English, I can then call the method for adding a special case:

tokenizer.add_special_case(""don't"", case)
The tokenizer will happily accept a special case that contains whitespace:

tokenizer.add_special_case(""some odd case"", case)
but it appears that does not actually change the behavior of the tokenizer or will never match?

More generally, what is the best way of extending an existing tokenizer so that the some patterns which normally would result in multiple tokens only create one token? For example something like [A-Za-z]+\([A-Za-z0-9]+\)[A-Za-z]+ should not result in three tokens because of the parentheses but in a single token, e.g. for asdf(a33b)xyz while the normal English rules should still apply if that pattern does not match.

Is this something that can be done somehow by augmenting an existing tokenizer or would I have to first tokenize, then find entities that match the corresponding token patterns and then merge the entity tokens?","As you found, Tokenizer.add_special_case() doesn't work for handling tokens that contain whitespace. That's for adding strings like ""o'clock"" and "":-)"", or expanding e.g. ""don't"" to ""do not"".

Modifying the prefix, suffix and infix rules (either by setting them on an existing tokenizer or creating a new tokenizer with custom parameters) also doesn't work since those are applied after whitespace splitting.

To override the whitespace splitting behavior, you have four options:

Merge after tokenization. You use Retokenizer.merge(), or possibly merge_entities or merge_noun_chunks. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#retokenization and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_entities and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_noun_chunks

This is your best bet for keeping as much of the default behavior as possible.
Subclass Tokenizer and override __call__. Sample code:

Implement a completely new tokenizer (without subclassing Tokenizer). Relevant docs here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#custom-tokenizer-example

What you are describing is called ""online learning"" and the default spaCy models don't support it. Most modern neural NER methods, even outside of spaCy, have no support for it at all.

You cannot fix this by using a custom training loop.

Your options are to use rule-based matching, so you can only match things explicitly in a list, or to retrain models on the fly.

Rule-based matching should be easy to set up but has the obvious issue that it can't learn things not explicitly in the list.

Training things on the fly may sound like it'll take too long, but you can train a small model quite quickly.

My first naive attempt was to load it via spacy.load('bert-base-uncased'), it didn't work because spacy demands a certain structure, which is understandable.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to use the spacy-transformers library to load the model, create the spacy structure, and use it from that point as a normal spacy-aware model.

I don't know if it is even possible as I couldn't find anything regarding the subject. I've tried to read the documentation but all guides, examples, and posts I found, start from a spacy structured model like spacy/en_core_web_sm, but how did that model was created in the first place?

","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

To pull from the docs, this is how you specify a custom model in a config:

[components.transformer.model]
@architectures = ""spacy-transformers.TransformerModel.v3""
# XXX You can change the model name here

tokenizer_config = {""use_fast"": true}
Going back to why you need to understand spaCy's structure, it's very important to understand that in spaCy, Transformers are only sources of features. If your HuggingFace model has an NER head or something it will not work. So if you use a custom model, you'll need to train other components, like NER, on top of it.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models. These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

You didn't mention this in your question, but is treating each sentence/line as a separate doc an option? (It's not clear if you're combining multiple lines and the sentence boundaries are wrong, or if you're passing in a single line but it's turning into multiple sentences.)

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

You didn't mention this in your question, but is treating each sentence/line as a separate doc an option? (It's not clear if you're combining multiple lines and the sentence boundaries are wrong, or if you're passing in a single line but it's turning into multiple sentences.)

44,Spacy,Stability,backwards,Stability aspect,52598788,spaCy: custom attributes not matching correctly?,"I have been having problems using custom extension attributes with the recently improved Matcher (spaCy 2.012). Even a simple example (mostly copied from here) is not working as I expected:
In other words, the rule correctly matches on the span 'have' (1, 2), but incorrectly matches 'have' (5, 6) and 'had' (6, 7). Furthermore, the callback function is not called. The custom attribute appears to be ignored.
The first rule functions as above. Then the second rule triggers, along with the callback function (which prints the message). There is an additional correct match for the new pattern along with the correct and erroneous matches from the first rule.

So, I have a few questions:

why does pattern1 match incorrectly? (i.e. why does the _ custom attribute constraint not apply?)
why does the callback function not work on the first call?
why does it work upon addition of a new rule?
In my own code, when using custom attributes as constraints in subsequent patterns, these patterns match on ALL tokens.

It's rather time consuming to product training data in this way, and it's open to error.

So we've built Prodigy, an annotation tool that integrates with spaCy and puts the model in the loop to help you train and evaluate models faster. It's currently in beta, but you can sign up for a free invite. Prodigy takes a slightly different approach to the click-drag-highlight-select concept of other annotation tools. It uses the model in the loop to suggest annotations with the most relevant gradient for training, and only asks you for a simple binary feedback: accept or reject. This lets you move through examples quickly. As you annotate, the model in the loop is updated, and its predictions will influence what Prodigy asks next.

This works especially well if you're looking to improve existing entity types present in your spaCy model, or if you're working with a large corpus of example text you want to use for annotation.

If you're looking for a tool more specifically for highlighting and annotating spans of text, you should also check out Brat.

For example, if a model doesn't exist, Python will raise an ImportError immediately. Similarly, if loading fails, you know there's likely a problem with the model's own loading and meta.

Btw: I'm one of the spaCy maintainers and I agree that the way spacy.load() currently works is definitely unideal and confusing. We're looking forward to finally changing this with the next major release. We're very close to releasing the first alpha of v2.0, which will solve this problem more elegantly, and will also include a lot of improvements to the training process and documentation.",Response from Spacy Maintainer,Ask deeper question,"Provide explanation for the answer.

enter image description here

'feedback' column contains natural language text to be processed,
'lemmatized' column contains lemmatized version of the feedback text,
'entities' column contains named entities extracted from the feedback text (I've trained the pipeline so that it will recognise car models and brands, labelling these as 'CAR_BRAND' and 'CAR_MODEL')
I then created the following function, which applies the Spacy nlp token to each row of my dataframe and extract any [noun + verb], [verb + noun], [adj + noun], [adj+ proper noun] combinations.
This is where I have a problem...

This is producing only one bigram per row maximum. How can I tweak the code so that more than one bigram can be extracted and put in a column? (Also are there more linguistic combinations I should try?)
Is there a possibility to find out what people are saying about 'CAR_BRAND' and 'CAR_MODEL' named entities extracted in the 'entities' column? For example 'Cool Porsche' - Some brands or models are made of more than two words so it's tricky to tackle.

I initiate ""spacy"" in each child process once and use this one spacy instance to handle the whole list of documents in the worker.

3 - EXPECTATIONS

I have seen a good recommendation to build a separated server-client solution [here]Is possible to keep spacy in memory to reduce the load time?

Is it possible to keep memory consumption under control using ""multiprocessing"" approach?

In this approach you may easily merge ""do"" and ""nt"", as well as strip space between the dot ""."" and preceding word. This method is not perfect, as there are multiple possible combinations of sentences that lead to specific spaCy tokenization.

Is there any way I can get crispy to be tagged as an adjective in the second case too?","TL;DR: You should accept the occasional error.

Details:

Spacy's tagger is statistical, meaning that the tags you get are its best estimate based on the data it was shown during training. I would guess those data did not contain the word dosa. The tagger had to guess, and guessed wrong. There isn't an easy way to correct its output, because it is not using rules or anything you can modify easily. The model has been trained on a standard corpus of English, which may be quite different to the kind of language you are using it for (domain). If error rate is too high for your purposes, you can re-train the model using domain-specific data. This will be very laborious though. Ask yourself what you are trying to achieve and whether 3% error rate in PoS tagging is the worst of your problems.

In general, you shouldn't judge the performance of a statistical system on a case-by-case basis. The accuracy of modern English PoS taggers is around 97%, which is roughly the same as the average human. You will inevitably get some errors. However, the errors of the model will not be the same as the human errors, as the two have ""learnt"" how to solve the problem in a different way.

Long answer

Use regular expressions
Change the spacy pipeline
The more information about the strings you need to make a decision, the longer it will take.

Good news is, if your cleaning of the text is relatively simplified, a few regular expressions might do the trick.

Otherwise you are using the spacy pipeline to help remove bits of text which is costly since it does many things by default:

Tokenisation
Lemmatisation
Dependency parsing
NER
Chunking
Alternatively, you can try your task again and turn off the aspects of the spacy pipeline you don't want which may speed it up quite a bit.

What I would like is to access a probability score (or something similar) from spaCy whenever it finds an entity that is not found by the BoW engine. Can I get spaCy to print out its own probability score for a given entity it has found? As in, ""Hi, I'm spaCy. I've found this token (or combination of tokens) that I'm X% certain is an entity of type BLAH."" I want to know that number X every time spaCy finds an entity. I imagine there must be such a number somewhere internally in spaCy's NER engine, plus a threshold value below which the possible entity is not flagged as an entity, and I'd like to know how to get my hands on that number. Thanks in advance.","Actually, there is an issue for that.

The author of the library, suggests there (among others) the following solution:

Beam search with global objective. This is the standard solution: use a global objective, so that the parser model is trained to prefer parses that are better overall. Keep N different candidates, and output the best one. This can be used to support confidence by looking at the alternate analyses in the beam. If an entity occurs in every analysis, the NER is more confident it's correct.

mportant note: The outputs you will get here are probably different from the outputs you would get using the Standard NER and not the beam search alternative. However, the beam search alternative provides you a metric of confidence that as I understand from your question is useful for your case.
