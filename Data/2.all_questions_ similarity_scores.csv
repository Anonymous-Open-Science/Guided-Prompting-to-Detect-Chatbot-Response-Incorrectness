tokenizer.add_special_case(""don't"", case)
The tokenizer will happily accept a special case that contains whitespace:

tokenizer.add_special_case(""some odd case"", case)
but it appears that does not actually change the behavior of the tokenizer or will never match?

More generally, what is the best way of extending an existing tokenizer so that the some patterns which normally would result in multiple tokens only create one token? For example something like [A-Za-z]+\([A-Za-z0-9]+\)[A-Za-z]+ should not result in three tokens because of the parentheses but in a single token, e.g. for asdf(a33b)xyz while the normal English rules should still apply if that pattern does not match.

Is this something that can be done somehow by augmenting an existing tokenizer or would I have to first tokenize, then find entities that match the corresponding token patterns and then merge the entity tokens?","As you found, Tokenizer.add_special_case() doesn't work for handling tokens that contain whitespace. That's for adding strings like ""o'clock"" and "":-)"", or expanding e.g. ""don't"" to ""do not"".

Modifying the prefix, suffix and infix rules (either by setting them on an existing tokenizer or creating a new tokenizer with custom parameters) also doesn't work since those are applied after whitespace splitting.

To override the whitespace splitting behavior, you have four options:

Merge after tokenization. You use Retokenizer.merge(), or possibly merge_entities or merge_noun_chunks. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#retokenization and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_entities and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_noun_chunks

This is your best bet for keeping as much of the default behavior as possible.
Subclass Tokenizer and override __call__. Sample code:

","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models.

","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

If your HuggingFace model has an NER head or something it will not work. So if you use a custom model, you'll need to train other components, like NER, on top of it.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models. These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

I've tried to read the documentation but all guides, examples, and posts I found, start from a spacy structured model like spacy/en_core_web_sm, but how did that model was created in the first place? I can believe someone has to train everything again with spacy.
","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

To pull from the docs, this is how you specify a custom model in a config:

[components.transformer.model]
@architectures = ""spacy-transformers.TransformerModel.v3""
# XXX You can change the model name here
name = ""bert-base-cased""
tokenizer_config = {""use_fast"": true}
Going back to why you need to understand spaCy's structure, it's very important to understand that in spaCy, Transformers are only sources of features. If your HuggingFace model has an NER head or something it will not work. So if you use a custom model, you'll need to train other components, like NER, on top of it.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models. These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

You didn't mention this in your question, but is treating each sentence/line as a separate doc an option? (It's not clear if you're combining multiple lines and the sentence boundaries are wrong, or if you're passing in a single line but it's turning into multiple sentences.)

Thanks a million for you answer! It made me go back to my documents and check every output of every element in the pipeline... Well, I feel terribly stupid, but I simply cannot reproduce my observation of a ""deffective parser"", everything seems fine now. I guess after my initial struggle with forcing my own sentence boundaries (which wasn't even actually that complicated ...), I convinced myself somehow it wasn't working even after my own boundaries were set ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

43,Spacy,Stability,backwards compatibility,Stability aspect,54201004,Multithreading with spacy: Is joblib necessary?,"In this part of the documentation, it is mentioned that nlp.pipe() works in parallel and the following example is given:

for doc in nlp.pipe(texts, batch_size=10000, n_threads=3):
    pass
After that, another, longer example is given that makes use of joblib. I don't quite understand the relationship between the two. As I understand the documentation, if I simply want to parallelize the tokenisation of many documents, the above, simple for loop will work and I do not have to use joblib, right?

My pipeline looks like this:

nlp = spacy.load('en', disable=['parser', 'ner', 'textcat'])
When would I need to use joblib?","Based on an answer in Spacy github issues:

We kept the n_threads argument to avoid breaking people's code, but unfortunately the implementation doesn't currently release the GIL, the way we did in v1. In v2 the neural network model is more complicated and more subject to change, so we haven't implemented it in Cython. We might at a later date.

In v2.1.0 (you can get an alpha by installing spacy-nightly, the matrix multiplications are now single-threaded. This makes it safe to launch multiple processes for the pipeline, so we can look at doing that internally. In the meantime, the n_threads argument sits idle...Which I agree is confusing, but removing it and breaking backwards compatibility seems worse.
Thus, to summarize: n_threads doesn't work in v2.1. What I'm doing now is using Spacy with joblib to read a dataset in minibatches.

Spacy released an example for that: Spacy Multiprocessing, and it works perfectly.

I have a dataset with almost ~4M short text. Without using the example they released, it took almost 23 hours to finish parsing them, but using joblib with spacy, it took 1 hour and half to finish!

So we've built Prodigy, an annotation tool that integrates with spaCy and puts the model in the loop to help you train and evaluate models faster. It's currently in beta, but you can sign up for a free invite. Prodigy takes a slightly different approach to the click-drag-highlight-select concept of other annotation tools. It uses the model in the loop to suggest annotations with the most relevant gradient for training, and only asks you for a simple binary feedback: accept or reject.

This works especially well if you're looking to improve existing entity types present in your spaCy model, or if you're working with a large corpus of example text you want to use for annotation.

I'm using ""spacy"" on python for text documents lemmatization. There are 500,000 documents having size up to 20 Mb of clean text.

The problem is the following: spacy memory consuming is growing in time till the whole memory is used.

2 - BACKGROUND

My hardware configuration: CPU: Intel I7-8700K 3.7 GHz (12 cores) Memory: 16 Gb SSD: 1 Tb GPU is onboard but is not used for this task

I'm using ""multiprocessing"" to split the task among several processes (workers). Each worker receives a list of documents to process. The main process performs monitoring of child processes. I initiate ""spacy"" in each child process once and use this one spacy instance to handle the whole list of documents in the worker.

3 - EXPECTATIONS

I have seen a good recommendation to build a separated server-client solution [here]Is possible to keep spacy in memory to reduce the load time?

Is it possible to keep memory consumption under control using ""multiprocessing"" approach?

In your example, you've come across an interesting case: the abstract string ""x-xxmessage-id:"" is split on punctuation, while the isolated lowercase string ""id"" is split into ""i"" and ""d"", because in written text, it's most commonly an alternate spelling of ""I'd"" or ""i'd"" (""I could"", ""I would"" etc.). You can find the respective rules here.

If you're dealing with specific texts that are substantially different from regular natural language texts, you usually want to customise the tokenization rules or possibly even add a Language subclass for your own custom ""dialect"". If there's a fixed number of cases you want to tokenize differently that can be expressed by rules, another option would be to add a component to your pipeline that merges the split tokens back together.

Finally, you could also try using the language-independent xx / MultiLanguage class instead. It still includes very basic tokenization rules, like splitting on punctuation, but none of the rules specific to the English language.

Details:

Spacy's tagger is statistical, meaning that the tags you get are its best estimate based on the data it was shown during training. I would guess those data did not contain the word dosa. The tagger had to guess, and guessed wrong. There isn't an easy way to correct its output, because it is not using rules or anything you can modify easily. The model has been trained on a standard corpus of English, which may be quite different to the kind of language you are using it for (domain). If error rate is too high for your purposes, you can re-train the model using domain-specific data. This will be very laborious though. Ask yourself what you are trying to achieve and whether 3% error rate in PoS tagging is the worst of your problems.

In general, you shouldn't judge the performance of a statistical system on a case-by-case basis. The accuracy of modern English PoS taggers is around 97%, which is roughly the same as the average human. You will inevitably get some errors. However, the errors of the model will not be the same as the human errors, as the two have ""learnt"" how to solve the problem in a different way.

Long answer

Use regular expressions
Change the spacy pipeline
The more information about the strings you need to make a decision, the longer it will take.

Good news is, if your cleaning of the text is relatively simplified, a few regular expressions might do the trick.

Otherwise you are using the spacy pipeline to help remove bits of text which is costly since it does many things by default:

Tokenisation
Lemmatisation
Dependency parsing
NER
Chunking
Alternatively, you can try your task again and turn off the aspects of the spacy pipeline you don't want which may speed it up quite a bit.

I was wondering if there is any way to make a vectorized form of my function or maybe and other way to speed up the process. Any idea ?","Short answer

This type of problem inherently takes time.

Long answer

Use regular expressions
Change the spacy pipeline
The more information about the strings you need to make a decision, the longer it will take.

Good news is, if your cleaning of the text is relatively simplified, a few regular expressions might do the trick.

Otherwise you are using the spacy pipeline to help remove bits of text which is costly since it does many things by default:

Tokenisation
Lemmatisation
Dependency parsing
NER
Chunking
Alternatively, you can try your task again and turn off the aspects of the spacy pipeline you don't want which may speed it up quite a bit.

For example, maybe turn off named entity recognition, tagging and dependency parsing...

nlp = spacy.load(""en"", disable=[""parser"", ""tagger"", ""ner""])
Then try again, it will speed up.",spacy support,Challenge with why,Why is Spacy considered to have good support for dependency parsing feature? ,"Spacy is considered to have good support for dependency parsing feature because it is one of the default features of the Spacy pipeline, which includes tokenization, lemmatization, NER, and chunking.

In your case, the single word ""consulting"" is being tagged as a noun, and the spaCy model you are using deems ""consulting"" to be the appropriate lemma for this case. You'll see if you change your string instead to ""consulting tomorrow"", spaCy will lemmatize ""consulting"" to ""consult"" as it is tagged as a verb (see output from the code below).

This works, but there are some sentences in my dataset that get splits into two by Spacy because they have two ROOTS. This results in having two fields for one sentence in the CoNLL format.

Example: A random sentence from my dataset is : ""teanna trump probably cleaner twitter hoe but""

Is there a way to save it all in one field instead of two even though it has two ROOTS so that 'but' becomes 7th item in field number 1? Which means it would look like this instead","I'd recommend using (or adapting) the textacy CoNLL exporter to get the right format, see: How to generate .conllu from a Doc object?

Spacy's parser is doing sentence segmentation and you're iterating over doc.sents, so you'll see each sentence it exported separately. If you want to provide your own sentence segmentation, you can do that with a custom component, e.g.:

def set_custom_boundaries(doc):
    for token in doc[:-1]:
        if token.text == ""..."":
            doc[token.i+1].is_sent_start = True
    return doc

nlp.add_pipe(set_custom_boundaries, before=""parser"")
Details (especially about how to handle None vs. False vs. True): https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#sbd-custom

Spacy's default models aren't trained on twitter-like text, the parser probably won't perform well with respect to sentence boundaries here.
