I think what happens here is that you actually came across an interesting (maybe non-ideal) edge case with the displacy defaults. To avoid very long dependency arcs for punctuation, the collapse_punct setting defaults to True. This means that when the visualisation is rendered, punctuation is merged onto the preceding token. Punctuation is identified by checking whether the token's is_punct attribute returns True – which also happens to be the case for "":)"".

In your example, you can work around this by setting collapse_punct to False in the options passed to displacy.serve:

displacy.serve(doc, style='dep', options={'collapse_punct': False})
(The displaCy visualizer should probably include an exception for emoticons when merging punctuation. This is currently difficult, because spaCy doesn't have an is_emoji or is_symbol flag.

More generally, what is the best way of extending an existing tokenizer so that the some patterns which normally would result in multiple tokens only create one token? For example something like [A-Za-z]+\([A-Za-z0-9]+\)[A-Za-z]+ should not result in three tokens because of the parentheses but in a single token, e.g. for asdf(a33b)xyz while the normal English rules should still apply if that pattern does not match.

Is this something that can be done somehow by augmenting an existing tokenizer or would I have to first tokenize, then find entities that match the corresponding token patterns and then merge the entity tokens?","As you found, Tokenizer.add_special_case() doesn't work for handling tokens that contain whitespace. That's for adding strings like ""o'clock"" and "":-)"", or expanding e.g. ""don't"" to ""do not"".

Modifying the prefix, suffix and infix rules (either by setting them on an existing tokenizer or creating a new tokenizer with custom parameters) also doesn't work since those are applied after whitespace splitting.

To override the whitespace splitting behavior, you have four options:

Merge after tokenization. You use Retokenizer.merge(), or possibly merge_entities or merge_noun_chunks. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#retokenization and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_entities and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_noun_chunks

This is your best bet for keeping as much of the default behavior as possible.
Subclass Tokenizer and override __call__. Sample code:

Implement a completely new tokenizer (without subclassing Tokenizer). Relevant docs here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#custom-tokenizer-example
Tokenize externally and instantiate Doc with words. Relevant docs here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#own-annotations
To answer the second part of your question, if you don't need to change whitespace splitting behavior, you have two other options:

Add to the default prefix, suffix and infix rules. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#native-tokenizer-additions

Note from https://stackoverflow.com/a/58112065/594211: ""You can add new patterns without defining a custom tokenizer, but there's no way to remove a pattern without defining a custom tokenizer.""
Instantiate Tokenizer with custom prefix, suffix and infix rules. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#native-tokenizers

To get the default rules, you read the existing tokenizer's attributes (as shown above) or use the nlp object’s Defaults.

What you are describing is called ""online learning"" and the default spaCy models don't support it. Most modern neural NER methods, even outside of spaCy, have no support for it at all.

You cannot fix this by using a custom training loop.

Your options are to use rule-based matching, so you can only match things explicitly in a list, or to retrain models on the fly.

Rule-based matching should be easy to set up but has the obvious issue that it can't learn things not explicitly in the list.

Training things on the fly may sound like it'll take too long, but you can train a small model quite quickly.

My first naive attempt was to load it via spacy.load('bert-base-uncased'), it didn't work because spacy demands a certain structure, which is understandable.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to use the spacy-transformers library to load the model, create the spacy structure, and use it from that point as a normal spacy-aware model.

I don't know if it is even possible as I couldn't find anything regarding the subject. I've tried to read the documentation but all guides, examples, and posts I found, start from a spacy structured model like spacy/en_core_web_sm, but how did that model was created in the first place? I can believe someone has to train everything again with spacy.
","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

To pull from the docs, this is how you specify a custom model in a config:

[components.transformer.model]
@architectures = ""spacy-transformers.TransformerModel.v3""
# XXX You can change the model name here
name = ""bert-base-cased""
tokenizer_config = {""use_fast"": true}
Going back to why you need to understand spaCy's structure, it's very important to understand that in spaCy, Transformers are only sources of features. If your HuggingFace model has an NER head or something it will not work. So if you use a custom model, you'll need to train other components, like NER, on top of it.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models. These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

You didn't mention this in your question, but is treating each sentence/line as a separate doc an option? (It's not clear if you're combining multiple lines and the sentence boundaries are wrong, or if you're passing in a single line but it's turning into multiple sentences.)

Thanks a million for you answer! It made me go back to my documents and check every output of every element in the pipeline... Well, I feel terribly stupid, but I simply cannot reproduce my observation of a ""deffective parser"", everything seems fine now. I guess after my initial struggle with forcing my own sentence boundaries (which wasn't even actually that complicated ...), I convinced myself somehow it wasn't working even after my own boundaries were set ?

As I understand the documentation, if I simply want to parallelize the tokenisation of many documents, the above, simple for loop will work and I do not have to use joblib, right?

My pipeline looks like this:

nlp = spacy.load('en', disable=['parser', 'ner', 'textcat'])
When would I need to use joblib?","Based on an answer in Spacy github issues:

We kept the n_threads argument to avoid breaking people's code, but unfortunately the implementation doesn't currently release the GIL, the way we did in v1. In v2 the neural network model is more complicated and more subject to change, so we haven't implemented it in Cython. We might at a later date.

In v2.1.0 (you can get an alpha by installing spacy-nightly, the matrix multiplications are now single-threaded. This makes it safe to launch multiple processes for the pipeline, so we can look at doing that internally. In the meantime, the n_threads argument sits idle...Which I agree is confusing, but removing it and breaking backwards compatibility seems worse.
Thus, to summarize: n_threads doesn't work in v2.1. What I'm doing now is using Spacy with joblib to read a dataset in minibatches.

Spacy released an example for that: Spacy Multiprocessing, and it works perfectly.

I have a dataset with almost ~4M short text. Without using the example they released, it took almost 23 hours to finish parsing them, but using joblib with spacy, it took 1 hour and half to finish!

In other words, the rule correctly matches on the span 'have' (1, 2), but incorrectly matches 'have' (5, 6) and 'had' (6, 7). Furthermore, the callback function is not called. The custom attribute appears to be ignored.
The first rule functions as above. Then the second rule triggers, along with the callback function (which prints the message). There is an additional correct match for the new pattern along with the correct and erroneous matches from the first rule.

So, I have a few questions:

why does pattern1 match incorrectly? (i.e. why does the _ custom attribute constraint not apply?)
why does the callback function not work on the first call?
why does it work upon addition of a new rule?

Initial setup

For each solution I start with an initial setup
Conclusion

The custom attributes with is limited to single token matching and the token matcher seems to be faster so that seems to be preferable. The EntityRuler seems to be the slowest which isn't surprising since it is changing the Doc.ents. It is however quite convenient that you have your matches in Doc.ents so you might want to consider this method still.

I was quite surprised that the token matcher outperforms the phrase matcher. I thought it would be opposite:

If you need to match large terminology lists, you can also use the PhraseMatcher and create Doc objects instead of token patterns, which is much more efficient overall
Question

Am I missing something important here or can I trust this analysis on a larger scale?","I think ultimately, it all comes down to finding the optimal tradeoff between speed, maintainability of the code and the way this piece of logic fits into the larger picture of your application. Finding a few strings in a text is unlikely to be the end goal of what you're trying to do – otherwise, you probably wouldn't be using spaCy and would stick to regular expressions. How your application needs to ""consume"" the result of the matching and what the matches mean in the larger context should motivate the approach you choose.

As you mention in the conclusion, if your matches are ""named entities"" by definition, adding them to the doc.ents makes a lot of sense and will even give you an easy way to combine your logic with statistical predictions. Even if it adds slightly more overhead, it'll likely still outperform any scaffolding you'd otherwise have to write around it yourself.",,Ask Query on Aspect,"Respond in 20 words How actively the library Spacy is maintained strictly based on the following conversation (question, answer).

","The problem here is that spacy.load() currently expects either a language ID (e.g. 'en'), or a shortcut link to a model that tells spaCy where to find the data. Because spaCy can't find a shortcut link, it assumes that 'my_model' is a language, which obviously doesn't exist.

You can set up a link for your model like this:

python -m spacy link my_model my_model # if it's installed via pip, or:
python -m spacy link /path/to/my_model/data my_model
This will create a symlink in the /spacy/data directory, so you should run it with admin permissions.

Alternatively, if you've created a model package that can be installed via pip, you can simply install and import it, and then call its load() method with no arguments:

import my_model
nlp = my_model.load()
In some cases, this way of loading models is actually more convenient, as it's cleaner and lets you debug your code more easily. For example, if a model doesn't exist, Python will raise an ImportError immediately. Similarly, if loading fails, you know there's likely a problem with the model's own loading and meta.

Btw: I'm one of the spaCy maintainers and I agree that the way spacy.load() currently works is definitely unideal and confusing.

Some ideas for improvement

Named entity recognition should be able to detect multi-word expressions, so brand and/or model names that consist of more than one token shouldn't be an issue if everything is set up correctly
Matching dependency patterns instead of linear patterns might slightly improve your results

The problem is the following: spacy memory consuming is growing in time till the whole memory is used.

2 - BACKGROUND

My hardware configuration: CPU: Intel I7-8700K 3.7 GHz (12 cores) Memory: 16 Gb SSD: 1 Tb GPU is onboard but is not used for this task

I'm using ""multiprocessing"" to split the task among several processes (workers). Each worker receives a list of documents to process. The main process performs monitoring of child processes. I initiate ""spacy"" in each child process once and use this one spacy instance to handle the whole list of documents in the worker.

3 - EXPECTATIONS

I have seen a good recommendation to build a separated server-client solution [here]Is possible to keep spacy in memory to reduce the load time?

Is it possible to keep memory consumption under control using ""multiprocessing"" approach?

In your example, you've come across an interesting case: the abstract string ""x-xxmessage-id:"" is split on punctuation, while the isolated lowercase string ""id"" is split into ""i"" and ""d"", because in written text, it's most commonly an alternate spelling of ""I'd"" or ""i'd"" (""I could"", ""I would"" etc.). You can find the respective rules here.

If you're dealing with specific texts that are substantially different from regular natural language texts, you usually want to customise the tokenization rules or possibly even add a Language subclass for your own custom ""dialect"". If there's a fixed number of cases you want to tokenize differently that can be expressed by rules, another option would be to add a component to your pipeline that merges the split tokens back together.

Finally, you could also try using the language-independent xx / MultiLanguage class instead. It still includes very basic tokenization rules, like splitting on punctuation, but none of the rules specific to the English language.

Details:

Spacy's tagger is statistical, meaning that the tags you get are its best estimate based on the data it was shown during training. I would guess those data did not contain the word dosa.

The model has been trained on a standard corpus of English, which may be quite different to the kind of language you are using it for (domain). If error rate is too high for your purposes, you can re-train the model using domain-specific data. This will be very laborious though. Ask yourself what you are trying to achieve and whether 3% error rate in PoS tagging is the worst of your problems.

In general, you shouldn't judge the performance of a statistical system on a case-by-case basis. The accuracy of modern English PoS taggers is around 97%, which is roughly the same as the average human. You will inevitably get some errors. However, the errors of the model will not be the same as the human errors, as the two have ""learnt"" how to solve the problem in a different way.

This type of problem inherently takes time.

Long answer

Use regular expressions
Change the spacy pipeline
The more information about the strings you need to make a decision, the longer it will take.

Good news is, if your cleaning of the text is relatively simplified, a few regular expressions might do the trick.

Otherwise you are using the spacy pipeline to help remove bits of text which is costly since it does many things by default:

Tokenisation
Lemmatisation
Dependency parsing
NER
Chunking

I avoided sentiment analysis tutorials, due to binary classification, since I need support for multiple categories. The trick was to set multi_class='auto' on the LogisticRegression linear model, and to use average='micro' on the precision score and precision recall, so all my text data, like entities, were leveraged:

classifier = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs', multi_class='auto')
and...

print(""Logistic Regression Accuracy:"",metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, predicted))

","The Spacy library offers a convenient way to perform name entity recognition to extract entities from a given sentence. To extract the named entities, the user should follow a set of guidelines provided in the documentation. In this case, the user should import the spacy module, load the 'en' model, which can be installed by running ""python3 -m spacy download en"", and then apply name entity recognition to a given sentence using the nlp object. The output of this code would be a set of named entities that appear in the input sentence. In the case of the provided code, the expected output was ""Alphabet"",""China,"" but instead, an empty set was returned. This indicates that there may be a mistake in the code, hence, the Spacy documentation needs to be referred to ensure that the right approach is being taken.

More generally, what is the best way of extending an existing tokenizer so that the some patterns which normally would result in multiple tokens only create one token? For example something like [A-Za-z]+\([A-Za-z0-9]+\)[A-Za-z]+ should not result in three tokens because of the parentheses but in a single token, e.g. for asdf(a33b)xyz while the normal English rules should still apply if that pattern does not match.

Is this something that can be done somehow by augmenting an existing tokenizer or would I have to first tokenize, then find entities that match the corresponding token patterns and then merge the entity tokens?","As you found, Tokenizer.add_special_case() doesn't work for handling tokens that contain whitespace. That's for adding strings like ""o'clock"" and "":-)"", or expanding e.g. ""don't"" to ""do not"".

Modifying the prefix, suffix and infix rules (either by setting them on an existing tokenizer or creating a new tokenizer with custom parameters) also doesn't work since those are applied after whitespace splitting.

To override the whitespace splitting behavior, you have four options:

Merge after tokenization. You use Retokenizer.merge(), or possibly merge_entities or merge_noun_chunks. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#retokenization and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_entities and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_noun_chunks

This is your best bet for keeping as much of the default behavior as possible.
Subclass Tokenizer and override __call__. Sample code:

Implement a completely new tokenizer (without subclassing Tokenizer). Relevant docs here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#custom-tokenizer-example
Tokenize externally and instantiate Doc with words. Relevant docs here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#own-annotations
To answer the second part of your question, if you don't need to change whitespace splitting behavior, you have two other options:

Add to the default prefix, suffix and infix rules. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#native-tokenizer-additions

Note from https://stackoverflow.com/a/58112065/594211: ""You can add new patterns without defining a custom tokenizer, but there's no way to remove a pattern without defining a custom tokenizer.""
Instantiate Tokenizer with custom prefix, suffix and infix rules. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#native-tokenizers

To get the default rules, you read the existing tokenizer's attributes (as shown above) or use the nlp object’s Defaults. There are code samples for the latter approach in https://stackoverflow.com/a/47502839/594211 and https://stackoverflow.com/a/58112065/594211.",Modify rules for patterns,Challenge with how,"What is the recommended approach to handle cases where multiple tokens are generated from a pattern in the Spacy tokenizer, and why is this approach suggested?

What you are describing is called ""online learning"" and the default spaCy models don't support it. Most modern neural NER methods, even outside of spaCy, have no support for it at all.

You cannot fix this by using a custom training loop.

Your options are to use rule-based matching, so you can only match things explicitly in a list, or to retrain models on the fly.

Rule-based matching should be easy to set up but has the obvious issue that it can't learn things not explicitly in the list.

Training things on the fly may sound like it'll take too long, but you can train a small model quite quickly. What you can do is train a small model for a small number of iterations while the user is working interactively, and after they've confirmed the model is more or less working correctly you can use the same training data for a larger model with longer training.",Ask Query on Aspect-how,Ask Query on Aspect-how,"Respond in less than 200 words How is the documentation of the library Spacy strictly based on the following conversation (question, answer).

While training models on the fly may seem time-consuming, a small model can be trained quickly for a small number of iterations while the user works interactively. Once the model is confirmed to be working correctly, the same training data can be used for a larger model with longer training.

The underlying statistical models of Spacy have been trained on a reference corpus that has already been tokenized using some strategy, and if the user's tokenization strategy is significantly different, there may be some performance degradation.

","The performance of Spacy is based on its efficient use of generators instead of processing texts one-by-one.

In addition, nlp.pipe() allows for the optimization of performance by configuring the batch size according to the system being used.

The first reason explains the issue with Spacy's performance when dealing with large datasets of short sentences. This reason highlights the problem that the user is facing, where high memory consumption and system crashes occur.

The second reason brings up a solution for Spacy performance issues using multithreading. Multithreading can help to create a faster pipeline for both tokenization and data ingestion.

The third reason explains how customization of the token filtering process can enhance Spacy's performance. By filtering tokens based on specific conditions, such as not being punctuation, space, stopword, and length, it is possible to improve Spacy's performance, as suggested in the answer.

The fourth reason highlights the reference points that can be used to customize Spacy's pipeline, including its token attributes and language.pipe. These references can be used to further improve Spacy's performance.",C20230628181859696501

My first naive attempt was to load it via spacy.load('bert-base-uncased'), it didn't work because spacy demands a certain structure, which is understandable.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to use the spacy-transformers library to load the model, create the spacy structure, and use it from that point as a normal spacy-aware model.

I don't know if it is even possible as I couldn't find anything regarding the subject. I've tried to read the documentation but all guides, examples, and posts I found, start from a spacy structured model like spacy/en_core_web_sm, but how did that model was created in the first place?

","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

To pull from the docs, this is how you specify a custom model in a config:

# XXX You can change the model name here

Going back to why you need to understand spaCy's structure, it's very important to understand that in spaCy, Transformers are only sources of features. If your HuggingFace model has an NER head or something it will not work. So if you use a custom model, you'll need to train other components, like NER, on top of it.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models. These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

To pull from the docs, this is how you specify a custom model in a config:

[components.transformer.model]
@architectures = ""spacy-transformers.TransformerModel.v3""
# XXX You can change the model name here
name = ""bert-base-cased""
tokenizer_config = {""use_fast"": true}
Going back to why you need to understand spaCy's structure, it's very important to understand that in spaCy, Transformers are only sources of features. If your HuggingFace model has an NER head or something it will not work. So if you use a custom model, you'll need to train other components, like NER, on top of it.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models. These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

With spaCy, as per the documentation, I can do:

which gives similarity for tokens in a specified string. But combing through the docs and searching, I can't figure out if there is a gensim-type way of listing all similar words for a preloaded model with either nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg') or nlp = spacy.load('en_vectors_web_lg'). Is there a way to do this?","I used Andy's response and it worked correctly but slowly. To resolve that I took the approach below.

SpaCy uses the cosine similarity, in the backend, to compute .similarity. Therefore, I decided to replace word.similarity(w) with its optimized counterpart. The optimized method that I worked with was cosine_similarity_numba(w.vector, word.vector), shown below, that uses the Numba library to speed up computations. You should replace line 12 in the most_similar method with the line below.

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

You didn't mention this in your question, but is treating each sentence/line as a separate doc an option? (It's not clear if you're combining multiple lines and the sentence boundaries are wrong, or if you're passing in a single line but it's turning into multiple sentences.)

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

You didn't mention this in your question, but is treating each sentence/line as a separate doc an option? (It's not clear if you're combining multiple lines and the sentence boundaries are wrong, or if you're passing in a single line but it's turning into multiple sentences.)

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

    pass
After that, another, longer example is given that makes use of joblib. I don't quite understand the relationship between the two. As I understand the documentation, if I simply want to parallelize the tokenisation of many documents, the above, simple for loop will work and I do not have to use joblib, right?

My pipeline looks like this:

nlp = spacy.load('en', disable=['parser', 'ner', 'textcat'])
When would I need to use joblib?","Based on an answer in Spacy github issues:

We kept the n_threads argument to avoid breaking people's code, but unfortunately the implementation doesn't currently release the GIL, the way we did in v1. In v2 the neural network model is more complicated and more subject to change, so we haven't implemented it in Cython. We might at a later date.

In v2.1.0 (you can get an alpha by installing spacy-nightly, the matrix multiplications are now single-threaded. This makes it safe to launch multiple processes for the pipeline, so we can look at doing that internally. In the meantime, the n_threads argument sits idle...Which I agree is confusing, but removing it and breaking backwards compatibility seems worse.
Thus, to summarize: n_threads doesn't work in v2.1. What I'm doing now is using Spacy with joblib to read a dataset in minibatches.

Spacy released an example for that: Spacy Multiprocessing, and it works perfectly.

I have a dataset with almost ~4M short text. Without using the example they released, it took almost 23 hours to finish parsing them, but using joblib with spacy, it took 1 hour and half to finish!

Explanation: 

The first reason provided is titled ""Normal Git Workflow"" and explains that small changes to a Python library like spaCy are typically saved in Git as they are made by the maintainer, but are only released to PyPI intentionally. This can cause small differences to exist between the files on a user's computer and the files in the Git repo, even with very recent releases.

The second reason given is titled ""PyCharm Decompilation Feature"" and clarifies that the code identified by the user as being in the file 'sentencizer.py' is not actually the true source code, but rather a result of the PyCharm decompilation feature. This means that PyCharm is reconstructing the code based on compiled files and binary data rather than directly accessing the original source code.

The third reason provided is titled ""Compiled .so files"" and explains that the 'sentencizer.pyx' file is compiled into a binary .so file that Python runs when the code is used. This means that the true implementation of the sentencizer class is not in the source code files but instead is contained in a binary file that is executed by Python when the code is run.",C20230628182303331517

Models are now hosted on GitHub, which makes the downloading process more transparent and doesn't rely on a separate download server.

Finally, you could also try using the language-independent xx / MultiLanguage class instead. It still includes very basic tokenization rules, like splitting on punctuation, but none of the rules specific to the English language.

Long answer

Use regular expressions
Change the spacy pipeline
The more information about the strings you need to make a decision, the longer it will take.

Good news is, if your cleaning of the text is relatively simplified, a few regular expressions might do the trick.

Otherwise you are using the spacy pipeline to help remove bits of text which is costly since it does many things by default:

Tokenisation
Lemmatisation
Dependency parsing
NER
Chunking
Alternatively, you can try your task again and turn off the aspects of the spacy pipeline you don't want which may speed it up quite a bit.

For example, maybe turn off named entity recognition, tagging and dependency parsing...

","Based on the conversation, there is no direct mention of Spacy's support for dependency parsing feature. However, the answer suggests that one of the default features of the Spacy pipeline is dependency parsing, which can significantly slow down the cleaning process. The answer also provides a possible solution to turn off this feature along with other unnecessary features to speed up the process.

Note that in general, you need to know the upos for the word in order to lemmatize correctly. This code will return all the possible lemmas but I would advise modifying it to pass in the correct upos for your word.

You could train an NER model for this, but be aware that its performance might not be as good on things like ""cold"" than it would be for actual named entities like ""London"".

To create the Knowledge Base and the Entity Linker from Wikipedia/Wikidata, the example scripts are not limited to named entities - they attempt to parse anything that appears in an intra-wiki link. If the word ""cold"" gets linked to the page ""Common cold"", it should be able to learn it. The exact entities that are stored in the KB and that are used for training the EL model, depend on which entities are found by your entity recognizer component. So if you adjust that according to your use-case, the entity linking component will follow automatically.",Suitability of spaCy,Challenge with how,"How accurate is the NER model for non-named entities and how does it affect the suitability of spaCy for the task?

","Spacy supports sentence segmentation through its dependency parser and with the use of the ""sentencizer"" component, which is a rule-based sentence segmenter. The advantage of using the parser is that it can handle more complex sentences and is more accurate overall. However, it requires loading a statistical model, which may not be desirable in certain cases. On the other hand, the sentencizer is a lightweight alternative that allows users to define their own segmentation rules without the need for a pre-trained model. 

The reason why Spacy does not include a sentence tokenizer out-of-the-box may have to do with the fact that it was designed for more advanced NLP tasks that require a deeper understanding of text, like named entity recognition and dependency parsing. The creators of Spacy may have assumed that users who needed a sentence tokenizer could easily create one using the sentencizer or use other available tools like NLTK. 

Overall, Spacy's approach to sentence segmentation appears to strike a balance between accuracy and flexibility, giving users the option to choose the method that best suits their needs.",C20230628183222078426

Spacy's parser is doing sentence segmentation and you're iterating over doc.sents, so you'll see each sentence it exported separately. If you want to provide your own sentence segmentation, you can do that with a custom component, e.g.:

The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#retokenization and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_entities and https://spacy.io/api/pipeline-functions#merge_noun_chunks

This is your best bet for keeping as much of the default behavior as possible.
Subclass Tokenizer and override __call__. Sample code:

Implement a completely new tokenizer (without subclassing Tokenizer). Relevant docs here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#custom-tokenizer-example
Tokenize externally and instantiate Doc with words. Relevant docs here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#own-annotations
To answer the second part of your question, if you don't need to change whitespace splitting behavior, you have two other options:

Add to the default prefix, suffix and infix rules. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#native-tokenizer-additions

Note from https://stackoverflow.com/a/58112065/594211: ""You can add new patterns without defining a custom tokenizer, but there's no way to remove a pattern without defining a custom tokenizer.""
Instantiate Tokenizer with custom prefix, suffix and infix rules. The relevant documentation is here: https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#native-tokenizers

To get the default rules, you read the existing tokenizer's attributes (as shown above) or use the nlp object’s Defaults. There are code samples for the latter approach in https://stackoverflow.com/a/47502839/594211 and https://stackoverflow.com/a/58112065/594211.",Modify rules for patterns,Challenge with really,"Really? Can you provide examples of custom prefix, suffix, and infix rules for handling cases with multiple tokens generated from a pattern?

I want to use spacy train (CLI) to take an existing model (custom NER model) and add the keyword and entity specified by the user, to that model. (Instead of training the whole model again). I can't find this anywhere in the documentation.

For example, let's say I have a model that is already trained for a custom entity of FOOD. (Pizza, Pasta, Bread, etc…). Now I want to take this existing model, and train it for a new entity called DRINKS with keywords like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Juice, etc… Using spacy train command for spacy v3.0.

The spacy train command that I am using currently is as follows:

I load the model for prediction using:

> nlp1 = spacy.load(R"".\output\model-best"")

What you are describing is called ""online learning"" and the default spaCy models don't support it. Most modern neural NER methods, even outside of spaCy, have no support for it at all.

You cannot fix this by using a custom training loop.

Your options are to use rule-based matching, so you can only match things explicitly in a list, or to retrain models on the fly.

Rule-based matching should be easy to set up but has the obvious issue that it can't learn things not explicitly in the list.

Training things on the fly may sound like it'll take too long, but you can train a small model quite quickly. What you can do is train a small model for a small number of iterations while the user is working interactively, and after they've confirmed the model is more or less working correctly you can use the same training data for a larger model with longer training.",Ask Query on Aspect-how,Challenge with really,"Respond in less than 200 words How is the documentation of the library Spacy strictly based on the following conversation (question, answer).

The user is looking for a way to take an existing custom NER model and add a new entity with specific keywords to it, using the spacy train command for Spacy v3.0. However, this is not possible with the default spaCy models and cannot be fixed by using a custom training loop.

Instead, the user's options are to use rule-based matching, which can only match things explicitly in a pre-defined list, or to retrain models on the fly. While training models on the fly may seem time-consuming, a small model can be trained quickly for a small number of iterations while the user works interactively.

You cannot fix this by using a custom training loop.

The underlying statistical models of Spacy have been trained on a reference corpus that has already been tokenized using some strategy, and if the user's tokenization strategy is significantly different, there may be some performance degradation.

","The performance of Spacy is based on its efficient use of generators instead of processing texts one-by-one.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to use the spacy-transformers library to load the model, create the spacy structure, and use it from that point as a normal spacy-aware model.

I don't know if it is even possible as I couldn't find anything regarding the subject.

","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

Going back to why you need to understand spaCy's structure, it's very important to understand that in spaCy, Transformers are only sources of features.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models. These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

29,Spacy,Performance,fast,Performance aspect,69738938,How to use existing huggingface-transformers model into spacy?,"I'm here to ask you guys if it is possible to use an existing trained huggingface-transformers model with spacy.

My first naive attempt was to load it via spacy.load('bert-base-uncased'), it didn't work because spacy demands a certain structure, which is understandable.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to use the spacy-transformers library to load the model, create the spacy structure, and use it from that point as a normal spacy-aware model.

I don't know if it is even possible as I couldn't find anything regarding the subject. I've tried to read the documentation but all guides, examples, and posts I found, start from a spacy structured model like spacy/en_core_web_sm, but how did that model was created in the first place? I can believe someone has to train everything again with spacy.
","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

To pull from the docs, this is how you specify a custom model in a config:

[components.transformer.model]
@architectures = ""spacy-transformers.TransformerModel.v3""
# XXX You can change the model name here
name = ""bert-base-cased""
tokenizer_config = {""use_fast"": true}
Going back to why you need to understand spaCy's structure, it's very important to understand that in spaCy, Transformers are only sources of features. If your HuggingFace model has an NER head or something it will not work. So if you use a custom model, you'll need to train other components, like NER, on top of it.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models. These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

For example, if you have domain-specific text data that differs significantly from the data used to train the built-in models, or if you have a specific NLP task that the models are not pre-trained to perform, such as sentiment analysis or intent recognition.

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

You didn't mention this in your question, but is treating each sentence/line as a separate doc an option? (It's not clear if you're combining multiple lines and the sentence boundaries are wrong, or if you're passing in a single line but it's turning into multiple sentences.)

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

You didn't mention this in your question, but is treating each sentence/line as a separate doc an option? (It's not clear if you're combining multiple lines and the sentence boundaries are wrong, or if you're passing in a single line but it's turning into multiple sentences.)

Explanation: 

The first reason provided is titled ""Normal Git Workflow"" and explains that small changes to a Python library like spaCy are typically saved in Git as they are made by the maintainer, but are only released to PyPI intentionally. This can cause small differences to exist between the files on a user's computer and the files in the Git repo, even with very recent releases.

The second reason given is titled ""PyCharm Decompilation Feature"" and clarifies that the code identified by the user as being in the file 'sentencizer.py' is not actually the true source code, but rather a result of the PyCharm decompilation feature. This means that PyCharm is reconstructing the code based on compiled files and binary data rather than directly accessing the original source code.

The third reason provided is titled ""Compiled .so files"" and explains that the 'sentencizer.pyx' file is compiled into a binary .so file that Python runs when the code is used. This means that the true implementation of the sentencizer class is not in the source code files but instead is contained in a binary file that is executed by Python when the code is run.",C20230628182303331517

All models are also attached as archives to the v1.6 release – so in the meantime, you can always download them manually from there, unzip the archive and place the contained folder in spacy/data.

If you don't have to use v1.3, I'd also recommend checking out the newer versions and upgrading to spaCy v1.7+. Models are now hosted on GitHub, which makes the downloading process more transparent and doesn't rely on a separate download server. They're also wrapped as native Python packages, which lets you install them via pip, add them to your project's requirements.txt and even import them as a module at the top of your file. You can read more about this in the models documentation.

This makes it easier to manage model dependencies, especially as more models become available. If you're using spaCy 1.8+, you'll be able to use models for English, German, French and Spanish.

Btw: I'm one of the spaCy maintainers and I agree that the way spacy.load() currently works is definitely unideal and confusing.

","Based on the conversation, it appears that the Spacy library is capable of supporting POS tagging to extract verb phrases. The user is able to use the `Doc` and `extract` functions provided by Spacy to define a regex pattern for verb phrases. Additionally, the user provides an alternative approach using the `make_spacy_doc` and `extract` functions from Textacy. However, it is noted that the results from the regex pattern may not be accurate, and the user suggests using POS tags instead.

Here it returns crispy as a noun instead of an adjective. However, if I use a test sentence like

a=""we had crispy fries""
It recognizes that crispy is an adjective. Here is the output:

[(we , u'PRP'), (had , u'VBD'), (crispy , u'JJ'), (fries, u'NNS')]
I think the primary reason why crispy wasn't tagged as an adjective in the first case was because dosa was tagged as 'NN' whereas fries was tagged as 'NNS' in the second case.

Is there any way I can get crispy to be tagged as an adjective in the second case too?","TL;DR: You should accept the occasional error.

Details:

Spacy's tagger is statistical, meaning that the tags you get are its best estimate based on the data it was shown during training. I would guess those data did not contain the word dosa. The tagger had to guess, and guessed wrong. There isn't an easy way to correct its output, because it is not using rules or anything you can modify easily. The model has been trained on a standard corpus of English, which may be quite different to the kind of language you are using it for (domain). If error rate is too high for your purposes, you can re-train the model using domain-specific data. This will be very laborious though. Ask yourself what you are trying to achieve and whether 3% error rate in PoS tagging is the worst of your problems.

In general, you shouldn't judge the performance of a statistical system on a case-by-case basis. The accuracy of modern English PoS taggers is around 97%, which is roughly the same as the average human. You will inevitably get some errors.

","Based on the conversation, Spacy appears to have a strong support for POS tagging feature. However, due to the statistical nature of its tagger, there is a possibility of occasional errors. The tagger does its best based on the data it has been trained on, and errors can occur for new or uncommon words. The accuracy of the modern English PoS taggers is around 97%, which is comparable to the average human performance. While there is no easy way to correct the errors, you can retrain the model with domain-specific data if you need to achieve better performance. However, this would require a significant amount of effort. Nonetheless, the occasional errors in PoS tagging may not matter in the larger context of the application. It is essential to evaluate the overall performance of the system, rather than judging it on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, Spacy's support for POS tagging feature is considered reliable, but it is important to keep in mind the limitations and potential for errors in the statistical model.",C20230628182845005310

Long answer

Use regular expressions
Change the spacy pipeline
The more information about the strings you need to make a decision, the longer it will take.

Good news is, if your cleaning of the text is relatively simplified, a few regular expressions might do the trick.

Otherwise you are using the spacy pipeline to help remove bits of text which is costly since it does many things by default:

Tokenisation
Lemmatisation
Dependency parsing
NER
Chunking
Alternatively, you can try your task again and turn off the aspects of the spacy pipeline you don't want which may speed it up quite a bit.

For example, maybe turn off named entity recognition, tagging and dependency parsing...

What I need is both ""This"" to be returned as index 0, both ""is"" to be returned as index 1 etc...","A spaCy Doc object also lets you iterate over the doc.sents, which are Span objects of the individual sentence. To get a span's start and end index in the parent document you can look at the start and end attribute.

for sent in doc.sents:
    for token in sent:

It incorrectly parses world :) as one token. How can I modify spaCy so it recognizes these additional symbols? Thanks.

edit: Found the following: https://github.com/ines/spacymoji but I think it only supports Unicode emojis like ✨ and not ASCII ones like :)","Yes, spaCy actually includes a pretty comprehensive list of text-based emoticons as part of its tokenizer exceptions.

I think what happens here is that you actually came across an interesting (maybe non-ideal) edge case with the displacy defaults. To avoid very long dependency arcs for punctuation, the collapse_punct setting defaults to True. This means that when the visualisation is rendered, punctuation is merged onto the preceding token.

In your example, you can work around this by setting collapse_punct to False in the options passed to displacy.serve:

displacy.serve(doc, style='dep', options={'collapse_punct': False})
(The displaCy visualizer should probably include an exception for emoticons when merging punctuation. This is currently difficult, because spaCy doesn't have an is_emoji or is_symbol flag.

However, the visualization in the original example incorrectly parses ""world :)"" as one token due to the default setting of collapse_punct to True. The solution is to set collapse_punct to False in the options passed to the displaCy visualizer. It is worth noting that while there is a GitHub repository for spaCy emojis, it currently only supports Unicode emojis and not ASCII ones like :). The conversation highlights a potential issue for spaCy and the displaCy visualizer, in that there is currently no is_emoji or is_symbol flag, which makes it difficult to include exceptions for emoticons when merging punctuation. Nevertheless, the use of spaCy for tokenizing and parsing emojis is relatively straightforward, with the exception of visualizations that may require additional options or modifications.",C20230628150909879386

The provided solution starts by initializing an optimizer, then shuffling the training data randomly for 100 iterations.

What you are describing is called ""online learning"" and the default spaCy models don't support it. Most modern neural NER methods, even outside of spaCy, have no support for it at all.

You cannot fix this by using a custom training loop.

Your options are to use rule-based matching, so you can only match things explicitly in a list, or to retrain models on the fly.

Rule-based matching should be easy to set up but has the obvious issue that it can't learn things not explicitly in the list.

Training things on the fly may sound like it'll take too long, but you can train a small model quite quickly.

29,Spacy,Performance,fast,Performance aspect,69738938,How to use existing huggingface-transformers model into spacy?,"I'm here to ask you guys if it is possible to use an existing trained huggingface-transformers model with spacy.

My first naive attempt was to load it via spacy.load('bert-base-uncased'), it didn't work because spacy demands a certain structure, which is understandable.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to use the spacy-transformers library to load the model, create the spacy structure, and use it from that point as a normal spacy-aware model.

I don't know if it is even possible as I couldn't find anything regarding the subject. I've tried to read the documentation but all guides, examples, and posts I found, start from a spacy structured model like spacy/en_core_web_sm, but how did that model was created in the first place? I can believe someone has to train everything again with spacy.
","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

To pull from the docs, this is how you specify a custom model in a config:

[components.transformer.model]
@architectures = ""spacy-transformers.TransformerModel.v3""
# XXX You can change the model name here
name = ""bert-base-cased""
tokenizer_config = {""use_fast"": true}
Going back to why you need to understand spaCy's structure, it's very important to understand that in spaCy, Transformers are only sources of features. If your HuggingFace model has an NER head or something it will not work. So if you use a custom model, you'll need to train other components, like NER, on top of it.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models. These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

The training process involves feeding the model a large quantity of text data and adjusting the model's parameters until it performs well on the defined tasks. Once the model is trained, it can be used as a starting point for further refinement or fine-tuning on specific tasks or domains. However, if you have a specific use case or domain that differs significantly from what the pre-trained models are prepped for, training a new model from scratch might be necessary. But even then, you could still use the spacy-transformers library to leverage all or part of a pre-trained HuggingFace model to get your new model up and running faster.",C20230628181922655878

My first naive attempt was to load it via spacy.load('bert-base-uncased'), it didn't work because spacy demands a certain structure, which is understandable.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to use the spacy-transformers library to load the model, create the spacy structure, and use it from that point as a normal spacy-aware model.

I don't know if it is even possible as I couldn't find anything regarding the subject.

","What you do is add a Transformer component to your pipeline and give the name of your HuggingFace model as a parameter to that. This is covered in the docs, though people do have trouble finding it. It's important to understand that a Transformer is only one piece of a spaCy pipeline, and you should understand how it all fits together.

To pull from the docs, this is how you specify a custom model in a config:

Going back to why you need to understand spaCy's structure, it's very important to understand that in spaCy, Transformers are only sources of features. If your HuggingFace model has an NER head or something it will not work. So if you use a custom model, you'll need to train other components, like NER, on top of it.

Also note that spaCy has a variety of non-Transformers built-in models. These are very fast to train and in many situations will give performance comparable to Transformers; even if they aren't as accurate, you can use the built-in models to get your pipeline configured and then just swap in a Transformer.

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

Some user suggested using span.merge() for a pretty similar topic, but the function doesn't seem to exist in recent releases of spaCy (Preventing spaCy splitting paragraph numbers into sentences)","The parser is supposed to respect sentence boundaries if they are set in advance. There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

Regarding some of your other points...

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

You didn't mention this in your question, but is treating each sentence/line as a separate doc an option? (It's not clear if you're combining multiple lines and the sentence boundaries are wrong, or if you're passing in a single line but it's turning into multiple sentences.)

Thanks a million for you answer! It made me go back to my documents and check every output of every element in the pipeline... Well, I feel terribly stupid, but I simply cannot reproduce my observation of a ""deffective parser"", everything seems fine now. I guess after my initial struggle with forcing my own sentence boundaries (which wasn't even actually that complicated ...), I convinced myself somehow it wasn't working even after my own boundaries were set ?

41,Spacy,Stability,bug,Stability aspect,68559878,Force 'parser' to not segment sentences?,"Is there an easy way to tell the ""parser"" pipe not to change the value of Token.is_sent_start ?

So, here is the story: I am working with documents that are pre-sentencized (1 line = 1 sentence), this segmentation is all I need. I realized the parser's segmentation is not always the same as in my documents, so I don't want to rely on the segmentation made by it.

I can't change the segmentation after the parser has done it, so I cannot correct it when it makes mistakes (you get an error). And if I segment the text myself and then apply the parser, it overrules the segmentation I've just made, so it doesn't work.

So, to force keeping the original segmentation and still use a pretrained transformer model (fr_dep_news_trf), I either :

disable the parser,
add a custom Pipe to nlp to set Token.is_sent_start how I want,
create the Doc with nlp(""an example"")
or, I simply create a Doc with

doc = Doc(words=[""an"", ""example""], sent_starts=[True, False])
and then I apply every element of the pipeline except the parser.

However, if I still do need the parser at some point (which I do, because I need to know some subtrees), If I simply apply it on my Doc, it overrules the segmentation already in place, so, in some cases, the segmentation is incorrect. So I do the following workaround:

Keep the correct segmentation in a list sentences = list(doc.sents)
Apply the parser on the doc
Work with whatever syntactic information the parser computed
Retrieve whatever sentencial information I need from the list I previously made, as I now cannot trust Token.is_sent_start.
It works, but it doesn't really feel right imho, it feels a bit messy. Is there an easier, cleaner way I missed ?

Something else I am considering is setting a custom extension, so that I would, for instance, use Token._.is_sent_start instead of the default Token.is_sent_start, and a custom Doc._.sents, but I fear it might be more confusing than helpful ...

There is one outstanding bug where this doesn't happen, but that was only in the case where some tokens had their sentence boundaries left unset.

If you set all the token boundaries to True or False (not None) and then run the parser, does it overwrite your values? If so it'd be great to have a specific example of that, because that sounds like a bug.

Given that, if you use a custom component to set your true sentence boundaries before the parser, it should work.

I don't think it makes any sense to keep your sentence boundaries separate from the parser's - if you do that you can end up with subtrees that span multiple sentences, which will just be weird and unhelpful.

My pipeline looks like this:

When would I need to use joblib?","Based on an answer in Spacy github issues:

We kept the n_threads argument to avoid breaking people's code, but unfortunately the implementation doesn't currently release the GIL, the way we did in v1. In v2 the neural network model is more complicated and more subject to change, so we haven't implemented it in Cython. We might at a later date.

In v2.1.0 (you can get an alpha by installing spacy-nightly, the matrix multiplications are now single-threaded. This makes it safe to launch multiple processes for the pipeline, so we can look at doing that internally. In the meantime, the n_threads argument sits idle...Which I agree is confusing, but removing it and breaking backwards compatibility seems worse.
Thus, to summarize: n_threads doesn't work in v2.1. What I'm doing now is using Spacy with joblib to read a dataset in minibatches.

Spacy released an example for that: Spacy Multiprocessing, and it works perfectly.

","Based on the provided conversation, it appears that Spacy's multithreading functionality is not as stable as it could be. While nlp.pipe() does work in parallel, the n_threads argument does not currently release the GIL in version 2, which is necessary for efficient parallel processing. However, in version 2.1.0, the matrix multiplications are now single-threaded, making it safe to launch multiple processes for the pipeline. Despite this, the n_threads argument remains idle, and joblib is still necessary for efficient parallel processing. 

Overall, it seems that Spacy's multithreading functionality is still being developed and optimized. However, joblib has been proven to work effectively with Spacy's pipeline, with users reporting significant reductions in processing time, such as 1 hour and a half for parsing almost 4M short texts. Therefore, while there may be some limitations and instability with Spacy's built-in multithreading, joblib is a well-tested and reliable alternative that can significantly improve processing efficiency.",C20230628182229215715

We kept the n_threads argument to avoid breaking people's code, but unfortunately the implementation doesn't currently release the GIL, the way we did in v1. In v2 the neural network model is more complicated and more subject to change, so we haven't implemented it in Cython. We might at a later date.

In v2.1.0 (you can get an alpha by installing spacy-nightly, the matrix multiplications are now single-threaded.

Explanation: 

The first reason provided is titled ""Normal Git Workflow"" and explains that small changes to a Python library like spaCy are typically saved in Git as they are made by the maintainer, but are only released to PyPI intentionally. This can cause small differences to exist between the files on a user's computer and the files in the Git repo, even with very recent releases.

The second reason given is titled ""PyCharm Decompilation Feature"" and clarifies that the code identified by the user as being in the file 'sentencizer.py' is not actually the true source code, but rather a result of the PyCharm decompilation feature. This means that PyCharm is reconstructing the code based on compiled files and binary data rather than directly accessing the original source code.

The third reason provided is titled ""Compiled .so files"" and explains that the 'sentencizer.pyx' file is compiled into a binary .so file that Python runs when the code is used. This means that the true implementation of the sentencizer class is not in the source code files but instead is contained in a binary file that is executed by Python when the code is run.",C20230628182303331517

50,Spacy,Active Maintenance,Maintain,Active Maintenance aspect,46826541,Methods for creating training data for SpaCy models?,"I recently began a NLP journey using SpaCy, and I have ~5,500 strings which I want to label up. For the first 100, I did this using a spreadsheet with custom columns, which was then run through a script to generate Python dictionaries. In the sheet, I have strored the string, label type, label value. The script then works out the position of the label value from within the string.

It's rather time consuming to product training data in this way, and it's open to error.

Are there any tools available to assist with this? I literally just need the ability to highlight a substring, and then choose the label type. I could build it myself, but I feel it may already exist.","I'm one of the maintainers of spaCy and we've actually been thinking about this problem a lot! So we've built Prodigy, an annotation tool that integrates with spaCy and puts the model in the loop to help you train and evaluate models faster. It's currently in beta, but you can sign up for a free invite. Prodigy takes a slightly different approach to the click-drag-highlight-select concept of other annotation tools. It uses the model in the loop to suggest annotations with the most relevant gradient for training, and only asks you for a simple binary feedback: accept or reject. This lets you move through examples quickly. As you annotate, the model in the loop is updated, and its predictions will influence what Prodigy asks next.

This works especially well if you're looking to improve existing entity types present in your spaCy model, or if you're working with a large corpus of example text you want to use for annotation.

If you're looking for a tool more specifically for highlighting and annotating spans of text, you should also check out Brat. I'm not 100% sure what the output looks like, but you should definitely be able to convert it to spaCy's training format.

Before I have installed ""mymodel"" using this tutorial and it was working good. When I want to use ""mymodel"" to add new entities I have a misunderstanding. Please, help me
","The problem here is that spacy.load() currently expects either a language ID (e.g. 'en'), or a shortcut link to a model that tells spaCy where to find the data. Because spaCy can't find a shortcut link, it assumes that 'my_model' is a language, which obviously doesn't exist.

You can set up a link for your model like this:

python -m spacy link my_model my_model # if it's installed via pip, or:
python -m spacy link /path/to/my_model/data my_model
This will create a symlink in the /spacy/data directory, so you should run it with admin permissions.

Alternatively, if you've created a model package that can be installed via pip, you can simply install and import it, and then call its load() method with no arguments:

import my_model
nlp = my_model.load()
In some cases, this way of loading models is actually more convenient, as it's cleaner and lets you debug your code more easily. For example, if a model doesn't exist, Python will raise an ImportError immediately. Similarly, if loading fails, you know there's likely a problem with the model's own loading and meta.

Btw: I'm one of the spaCy maintainers and I agree that the way spacy.load() currently works is definitely unideal and confusing.

In your example, you've come across an interesting case: the abstract string ""x-xxmessage-id:"" is split on punctuation, while the isolated lowercase string ""id"" is split into ""i"" and ""d"", because in written text, it's most commonly an alternate spelling of ""I'd"" or ""i'd"" (""I could"", ""I would"" etc.). You can find the respective rules here.

If you're dealing with specific texts that are substantially different from regular natural language texts, you usually want to customise the tokenization rules or possibly even add a Language subclass for your own custom ""dialect"". If there's a fixed number of cases you want to tokenize differently that can be expressed by rules, another option would be to add a component to your pipeline that merges the split tokens back together.

Finally, you could also try using the language-independent xx / MultiLanguage class instead. It still includes very basic tokenization rules, like splitting on punctuation, but none of the rules specific to the English language.

While it generally works well for general-purpose text, it may not work as expected for specific cases. In the given example, the string ""x-xxmessage-id:"" is split on punctuation, while the isolated lowercase string ""id"" is split into ""i"" and ""d"" because it is commonly used as an alternate spelling of ""I'd"" or ""i'd"" in written text. In such cases, you can customize the tokenization rules or add a language subclass for specific dialects. Additionally, you can add a component to the pipeline that merges split tokens back together or use the language-independent xx/MultiLanguage class.

Long answer

Use regular expressions
Change the spacy pipeline
The more information about the strings you need to make a decision, the longer it will take.

Good news is, if your cleaning of the text is relatively simplified, a few regular expressions might do the trick.

Otherwise you are using the spacy pipeline to help remove bits of text which is costly since it does many things by default:

Tokenisation
Lemmatisation
Dependency parsing
NER
Chunking
Alternatively, you can try your task again and turn off the aspects of the spacy pipeline you don't want which may speed it up quite a bit.

","Based on the conversation, it appears that spaCy supports entity linking feature for named entities, but it is possible to train an NER model to identify other important entities. In addition, creating a Knowledge Base and Entity Linker from Wikipedia/Wikidata can potentially link other entities as well.

span.ent_label_ = ""COLOR"" # the label you want
